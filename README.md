# Overview: An Easy Button for Agentic RAG
This Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application uses an agentic approach to combine web search, hallucination controls and accuracy checks with RAG. It's easy to modify because its a simple Gradio app.

> **Note**
>This app runs in [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/overview/introduction.html). It's a free, lightweight developer platform that you can run on your own systems to get up and running with complex AI applications and workloads in a short amount of time. 

> You may want to [**fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository into your own account before proceeding. Otherwise you won't be able to fully retain any changes you make because this NVIDIA owned repository is **read-only**.

## The Agentic RAG Application
#### Using the Application
1. You embed your documents (pdfs or webpages) to the vector database. 

2. You configure each of the separate components for the pipeline. For each component you can:
   * Select from a drop down of endpoints or use a self-hosted endpoint.
   * Modify the prompt.
3. You submit your query.
4. An LLM evaluates your query for relevance to the index and then routes it to the DB or to search by [Tavily](https://tavily.com/).
5. Answers are checked for hallucination and relevance. "Failing"" answers are run through the  process again.

The diagram **below** shows this agentic flow.

#### Modifying the Application

* Directly within the app you can:
   * Change the prompts for the different components, e.g. the hallucination grader.
   * Change the webpages and pdfs you want to use for the context in the RAG.
   * Select different endpoints from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover) for the inference components.
   * Configure it to use self-hosted endpoints with [NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIMs)](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nim/teams/meta/containers/llama3-8b-instruct/tags) or [Ollama](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama).
* You can also modify the application code to:
   * Add new endpoints and endpoint providers
   * Change the Gradio interface or the application structure and logic.

> **Note** Setting up self-hosted endpoints is relatively advanced because you will need to do it manually. 

## Get Started

The quickest path is with the pre-configured build.nvidia.com endpoints. 

#### Prerequisites for Using Pre-configured Endpoints

1. Install [AI Workbench](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/installation/overview.html).

2. Get an NVIDIA Developer Account and an API key.
   * Go to [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/) and click `Login`.
   * Create account, verify email.
   * Make a Cloud Account.
   * Click your initial > `API Keys`.
   * Create and save your key.

3. Get a Tavily account and an API key.
   * Go to [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) and create an account.
   * Create an API key on the overview page.
     
4. Have some pdfs or web pages to put in the RAG.

5. NVIDIA Employees: Configure `INTERNAL_API` API key to use internal endpoints instead of public ones.


#### Opening the Chat
   
1. Open NVIDIA AI Workbench. Select a [location to work in](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/locations/locations.html).
   
2. Use the repository URL to clone this project with AI Workbench and wait for it to build.
   
3. Add your NVIDIA API key and the Tavily API key when prompted.

4. Open the **Chat** from Workbench. It should automatically open in a new browser tab.

5. Upload your documents and change the Router prompt to focus on your uploaded documents. 

6. Start chatting.

## Deep Dive

> **Note** This assumes you've done the **Get Started** steps.

#### Using Self-Hosted Endpoints

You can configure any or all pipeline components (Router, Generator, Retrieval, Hallucination Check, Answer Check) to use self-hosted endpoints independently. This means you can mix and match between hosted and self-hosted components based on your needs. The application includes built-in GPU compatibility checking to help you select appropriate models for your hardware configuration.

Prerequisites:
* NVIDIA GPU(s) with appropriate VRAM
* Ubuntu 22.04 or later with latest NVIDIA drivers
* Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit

To set up NIM endpoints for your components:
1. Check the [NIM documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/getting-started.html) for detailed setup instructions
2. For each component you want to self-host:
   * Select "NIM Endpoints" in the component's configuration
   * Choose your GPU type and count - the UI will automatically show only compatible models
   * Enter your endpoint details (host, port)
3. Components not set to self-hosted will continue using their configured cloud endpoints

The application will validate your GPU configuration for each component and prevent incompatible model selections. You can use different GPU configurations for different components based on their computational needs.
